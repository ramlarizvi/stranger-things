        <p>Stranger Things is set in 1980s Indiana, where a teen with powerful psychic powers escapes a sinister government installation. Eleven joins forces with local nerds Mike, Dustin, Lucas and Will to battle demogorgons, the Mind Flayer and other monsters, including the chillingly calculating Dr Brenner.         </p>
        <p>Episode 8 ended with Brenner dying in the dust of the desert, but he's left a whole heap of trouble behind: His experiments on psychic kids led to Eleven zapping troubled youngster Henry Creel into the parallel dimension of the Upside Down years ago, where he became season 4's demonic villain Vecna.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile Sheriff Jim Hopper, Joyce and Murray try to escape a brutal Russian gulag with the help of duplicitous former guard Antonov (aka Enzo) and madcap smuggler Yuri. Episode 9 opens with Jim and Joyce facing the same problem as Eleven, Will, Mike, Jonathan and Surfer Boy brochacho Argyle: They have to get back to Hawkins before Vecna kills again and opens a fourth gate to the dark dimension. Steve, Nancy, Robin, Dustin and Eddie Munson tool up to infiltrate the Upside Down and stake Vecna in his coffin, while Lucas and Erica enter the terrifying Creel mansion to offer Max as bait. In the series finale, only the Hawkins kids (and Kate Bush) can save the world.</p>
